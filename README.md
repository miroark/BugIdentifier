# BugIdentifier
Final Project for Mobile Computing Class. First stage of project just creates the interface and infrstructure for the AI. Final stage would be to design, and implement an ANN to identify/classify various species of insects.

This project was an idea I had conjured up speaking to my cousins, and other family members. They mentioned how neat it would be to be able to take out a phone and find out what an insect was.

Having been interested in AI and doing inpedendant studies I mulled the idea over in my head for a while. The very next school semester I signed up for a mobile computing class. I figured it'd be the perfect opportunity to begin development on the app that I had been thinking about.

For the school project however I decided it would be infeasible to attempt to design and implement the ANN. Instead I treated the AI as a black box.
The AI would be implemented in such a way that a single call would be required to identify a bug from a jpg captured by the phone.

The project currently only has the prototype interface that the app will use. It includes a camera activity/layout, an activity/layout to view previous captures by the user, and an activity/layout that allwos users to get a better view of the image they took and information gathered.

Users are also allowed to update the information on the picture to help crowdsource the data needed for the development of the AI.
